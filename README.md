# CLICKbase Template V2.FCStd

Generator template project in FreeCAD using the Gridfinity Workbench. It modifies the standard baseplate to replicate the CLICKbase features by John Hall (https://www.printables.com/model/982173-clickbase-a-no-magnet-latching-gridfinity-baseplat).
It can create M x N sized grids with fully custom grid size (default is 42mm of course) and even fine tune the clamping force by tuning the thickness of the clamp blocks and the spring section of the frame. Just edit the variable set in the project and it generates your custom CLICKbase.
